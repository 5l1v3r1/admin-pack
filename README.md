Admin Pack
==========

A PHP toolkit designed specifically for programmers to quickly create a nice-looking, custom-built, secure administrative web interface.  Choose from a MIT or LGPL license.  Proven to cut development time by at least 50% over traditional frameworks and template engines.  But it isn't a CMS nor a framework or a template engine.  Admin Pack is very different.  Give it a go to power your next PHP-based administrative backend.

Be sure to check out [Admin Pack with Extras](https://github.com/cubiclesoft/admin-pack-with-extras).  It is Admin Pack plus some extra options with Javascript components (e.g. a convenient visual date picker widget) in a slightly beefier package.

Features
--------

* Quick-n-dirty custom administrative interface builder.
* The default templates look nice enough.  Gets the job done.
* Integrated CSRF/XSRF defenses.
* Very lightweight (~180KB).
* Has a liberal open source license.  MIT or LGPL, your choice.
* Designed for relatively painless integration into your project.
* Sits on GitHub for all of that pull request and issue tracker goodness to easily submit changes and ideas respectively.

Under the Hood
--------------

Admin Pack uses [FlexForms](https://github.com/cubiclesoft/php-flexforms), which makes it easy to extend Admin Pack with custom functionality (see `support/view_print_layout.php`).  For example, [FlexForms Modules](https://github.com/cubiclesoft/php-flexforms-modules) contains several official extensions (e.g. charts, HTML editor, character/word counter).
